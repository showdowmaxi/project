This folder contains guided and unguided projects from DataCamp

Guided projects allow practicing data science skills in data cleaning, data visualization, and machine learning algorithms.
Some projects have some existed codes with relevant hints for the next steps to complete the entire project.

Unguided projects tend to focus on data cleaning to answer specific questions with free-style exploring datasets.

These projects have small size datasets but they are practical in solving some real-world problems.
